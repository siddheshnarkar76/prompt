SUPABASE BUCKET SETUP REQUIRED

Your upload is failing because Supabase storage buckets don't exist.

MANUAL SETUP STEPS:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: dntmhjlbxirtgslzwbui
3. Go to Storage > Buckets
4. Create these buckets:

   Bucket: "files"
   - Public: No (Private)
   - File size limit: 50MB
   - Allowed MIME types: image/*, application/pdf, text/*, application/*

   Bucket: "previews"
   - Public: No (Private)
   - File size limit: 100MB
   - Allowed MIME types: model/gltf-binary, application/octet-stream

   Bucket: "geometry"
   - Public: No (Private)
   - File size limit: 100MB
   - Allowed MIME types: application/octet-stream, model/*

   Bucket: "compliance"
   - Public: No (Private)
   - File size limit: 50MB
   - Allowed MIME types: application/zip, application/x-zip-compressed

5. After creating buckets, your /api/v1/upload endpoint will work!

QUICK FIX: Create just the "files" bucket first to fix the immediate upload error.
